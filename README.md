## What am I?

An Amazon price tracker! I grab the current pricing from Amazon, and I stash it in an excel file, and when the price gets to one that too cheap for you to pass up, I send you a text!

## Getting Started

cmd line

## Dependencies

You might need to pip install xlrd because we work with excel also. Or you can change the output to csv as well.

```
BeautifulSoup
requests
pandas
```
